## Proto Algo for big
- Standardize each number to start from 0 **See Below**
- Convert each number to its binary representation
- Check right most bit and push everything that is not 1 to B and rotate A
- Push from B until empty
- Repeat with next rightmost bit

## Operations Used
- Rotate a and push (a & b)
- Swap a for less than or equal to 5 numbers

## Standardization
- Duplicate the array
- Sort it
- Compare the two and assign based on index of match
